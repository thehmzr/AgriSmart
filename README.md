## Background

Agriculture has been the backbone of human civilization, relying on traditional methods passed down through generations. However, with the rapid advancements in technology, there is a growing need to integrate modern tools into farming practices. The AgriSmartPro mobile app addresses this need by offering a comprehensive digital solution that leverages AI and real-time data to assist farmers in Pakistan, where 70% of exports are linked to agriculture, and 47% of the land is agricultural. The app aims to bridge the gap between traditional farming methods and modern technological solutions to enhance productivity and sustainability.
